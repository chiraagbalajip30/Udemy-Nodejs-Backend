MODULES - It is a collection of code, that provides your functionality. There are 3 types:

1. Built In Modules
2. Third Party or External Modules - which can be installed using npm intall
3. Custom Modules (my own)

Built In Modules
--------------------
File System Module (fs)

was given beacuse nodejs is a js built into c program, they have given whole fs modules, which helps us to work onnode modules in the machine.

if you want to read the files, use readFileSync. You have to add the binary code format like utf-8 to see the content properly

fs.readFileSync() is a method from Node.js's built-in fs (File System) module. "It reads the entire contents of a file from your disk synchronously" (meaning it blocks / pauses your entire program until the reading is finished).

These below sync and async haven't be thought yet

Use Sync (...Sync): Quick scripts, config loading at startup, learning, build tools, when order matters and you don't mind blocking
Use Async/Promises: Servers, APIs, apps that handle many requests — never block the event loop!



Operation,Synchronous (blocking),Asynchronous Callback,Promise / async-await (best in 2026),What it does
Read whole file,"fs.readFileSync(path, [options])","fs.readFile(path, options, callback)","fsPromises.readFile(path, options)",Read entire file content
Write / overwrite file,"fs.writeFileSync(file, data, [options])","fs.writeFile(file, data, options, cb)","fsPromises.writeFile(file, data, options)",Create or replace file with new content
Append to file,"fs.appendFileSync(file, data, [options])","fs.appendFile(file, data, options, cb)","fsPromises.appendFile(file, data, options)",Add text to the end of file
Delete file,fs.unlinkSync(path),"fs.unlink(path, callback)",fsPromises.unlink(path),Remove / delete file
Create directory,"fs.mkdirSync(path, [options])","fs.mkdir(path, options, callback)","fsPromises.mkdir(path, options)",Make a new folder
Read directory contents,"fs.readdirSync(path, [options])","fs.readdir(path, options, callback)","fsPromises.readdir(path, options)",List files/folders in a directory
Check if exists,fs.existsSync(path) (old) or use fs.accessSync,"fs.exists(path, cb) (deprecated)","fsPromises.access(path, mode)",Check file/dir accessibility


there will be a wrapper which wraps the entire typed code in node.js
Example:

function wrapper (exports, requests, module, --filename, --dirname) {
    const fs = require("fs");
    // console.log(fs);

    const content = fs.readFileSync("notes.txt", 'utf-8');
    console.log(content);
}

here, require function can be used only because require function is present within the wrapper. I fyou try to use require in browser console, you can't access it nd returns error.

Node.js gives require function, lind of module name i want to load. It checks if there are any 3rd party installation(json web token) along with the or present in the module. Then it checks for built-in module(fs). But both are not there, it throws an error.

require('./math.js')  -  one dot is single directory, two dots means behind 2 directories. So, if you use './', nodejs will get to know that it is a 'custom module'.

require also does something called as "internal Caching" which we will be explained in the upcoming topics.
