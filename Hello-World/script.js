// alert("wejhvfkdh");  won't work

// if i try writing alert, it won't work because it is browser's object not Js's.

// 2 diff env to run JS

// Browser (JS, Browser API - fetch, alert)
// setTimeout - webAPI valid in browser

// NodeJS - (JS, Extra - file system, file handling, etc)
// setTimeout - valid in node.js. the reason is developer of nodejs has carefully added the things required for the backend but not everything.
