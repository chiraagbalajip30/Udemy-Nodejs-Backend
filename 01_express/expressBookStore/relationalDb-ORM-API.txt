To begin with, let's understand what the applications in real-world look like.
So, client(through frontend) interacts with the server(which is currently being built in Node.js).
The purpose of the server is to accept or take the request, and do some processing on the response, and hen return back the response. 
There is a lot of work to do while processing the data. While processing the data, you might have to get some data from the database, you might want to add some data into the database, or update something, or do something in the cache store, trigger some email, etc, and then send back the response. 
So, the most or commonly used thing here is the database. 
Database -  It is a system or a place where you can store all the application data. Ex, users signes up, passwords, preferences, data, etc. So, interacting and modeeling the database is an important thing, and is very important for the backend engineer.
There are 2 types of database: NOSQL and SQL Database.

SQL:
-------
Relational Database
Structured Data
Ex: Users object has id, name, email, pasword, profile image, etc. If we are building something like Facebook. You have multiple users. Now we will assign user A, user B, user C. Now, A has sent request to B, and we have to build a relationship between A and B in the database. So, we will create a Friends table in the database. So to identify friends, user_first and user_second, then user_first and user_third.
user_first:A             user_first:A
user_second:B            user_third:C
So, if we want to check how many friends a or b or c has, we can identify that A has 2 friends, B has 1 and C has 1. Also, B and C has one mutual friend A.

So, two make relatioships beween them, we use relational dbs, and it is very structured. 
Here, in this example, we are talking about one-many relationship. 

Database Examples - MySQL, Postgres, etc.


NOSQL:
-------
Non-Relational  Database
Non-Structured data

Here,there are no relations. If i try to access gender columns without initalizing or adding it, it will throw an error that first we have to create a column, and then use or initialize it. Wehereas, in NOSQL or non-relational db, we can do that. Here, we have users table, and we can store any key and any value inside it. So, for storing friends, we can create an array, and then store friends as a, b,c. There are no relationships or boundaries here. Flexibility is more here. 

Database Examples - MongoDB.

Here, in this course, we will learn Postgres first and later move onto MongoDB because, learning structured db is very much required, and it gives proper idea about the database. Once we learn Relational DB, then Non-Relational Db would be a piece of cake to learn.
